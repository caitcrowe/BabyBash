AI Audio Removal

This is a prototype of AI driven software that aims to remove unwanted noises from input audio signals.  In this case, we aim to dampen the sound of crying babies.

This project uses audio files from both the DonateACry audio corpus for positive audio samples (https://github.com/gveres/donateacry-corpus) and the ESC-50 Dataset for both positive and negative audio samples (https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50).

### Current branches:
  - interference: dampening of the detected cry & output of the filtered audio
  - optimization: improvements to the neural network to increase accuracy
  - testing: test cases to ensure all functions are working as expected
  - refactor: code refactoring to improve readability & encapsulation
  - gui: development of a GUI to allow for toggling of the filter and choice of audio devices
